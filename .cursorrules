# Cyberpunk 2077 RedScript Mod - Reinforcements Gang vs Gang

## Project Overview

This is a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that implements a dynamic gang reinforcement system using RedScript.
The mod allows different gangs to call for reinforcements when fighting eachother.
This system does not directly involve the player; it enables a form of combat voyuerism for the player.

It operates on a simple cyclic intensity system governed by cooldowns, where each gang starts at some initial heat, is allowed to make a few calls, and then resets to baseline.
This enables a lightweight and unobtrusive system that does not rely on complex game engine state management, and affords some semblance of organic behaviours to the player.

## File Structure

-   `r6/scripts/` - RedScript source files
-   `r6/tweaks/` - YAML configuration files for game tweaks - NEVER TOUCH THESE FILES EVER.
-   `GangData/` - Gang-specific data definitions
-   `GangHandlers/` - Gang-specific logic handlers
-   `Localization/` - Multi-language support files

## Code Style & Conventions

### RedScript (.reds files)

-   Use PascalCase for class names and public methods
-   Use camelCase for variables and private methods
-   Follow RedScript naming conventions for game API calls
-   Use descriptive names for gang-related variables and methods
-   Comment complex logic, especially game API interactions

### YAML Configuration

-   Use snake_case for file names
-   Keep YAML structure consistent across gang files
-   Use meaningful keys that match gang names
-   Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

## Development Guidelines

### Localization

-   All user-facing strings must be localized
-   Use the existing localization key format
-   Add new keys to all language files when adding new strings
-   Keep English (en_us) as the reference language
-   Mod title must stay in english (this is commonly accepted practice in Cyberpunk modding community)
-   Localisations must be internally consistent and leverage accepted gaming specific terminologies whenever appropriate.
-   We are not providing professional grade formal translations, just whatever the community in a given language is likely to understand without thinking about it too hard.
-   Avoid language that might refer to Police-Vs-Player specifics like "wanted level"; heat/intensity are preferred terms

### Logging

-   Logging always uses the GRLog function.
-   Never prefix log call strings, this is already done by the wrapper function.
-   Use string interpolation e.g GRLog(s"my random log message \\(someVar)")
-   prefer concise log structures e.g "(affiliation), Vehicles: (count)"

### Settings

-   All configurable options should go through the Settings system
-   Use descriptive setting names
-   Provide sensible defaults

## Notes

-   This mod modifies game behavior at runtime
-   Be careful with game API calls to avoid crashes
-   Consider performance impact of dynamic spawning
-   Maintain compatibility with other mods
-   PERFORMANCE IS KING

## Deployment target

Z:\\GOG\\Cyberpunk 2077

-   game root contains the r6 folder, where these files can be deposited without special steps.
