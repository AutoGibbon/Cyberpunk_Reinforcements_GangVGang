Version 2.0.0
> Introducing The Mox!
	- Preferring smart weapons and stun batons, they will now patrol the Kabuki area.
	- Added 8 new Moxies to support this feature
	- (sometimes a Mox will spawn and use the appearance of Rita Wheeler. This is not on purpose, I might change it, I might not)
> NCPD units rework
	- Maxtac are no longer spawned, and have been replaced with custom NCPD elites bearing heavy weapons.
	- This lets Maxtac remain the big bad who respond to the only cyberpsycho in town (you, apparently), and not ruin any illusions of their power in Night City
	- Added 5 new Elite NCPD responders to support this rework.
> Gang Turf Patrols!
	- Each gang will now patrol their turf in their signature vehicles
	- This is a temporary feature, as I know some smart people are working on an independent version of this wonderful idea.
	- Arasaka, Barghest, Scavs, NCPD do not have turf patrols
