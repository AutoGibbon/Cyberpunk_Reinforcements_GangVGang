Version 2.0.0
> Introducing The Mox!
	- Preferring smart weapons and stun batons, they will now patrol the Kabuki area.
	- Added 8 new Moxies to support this feature
	- (sometimes a Mox will spawn and use the appearance of Rita Wheeler. This is not on purpose, I might change it, I might not)
> NCPD units rework
	- Maxtac are no longer spawned, and have been replaced with custom NCPD elites bearing heavy weapons.
	- This lets Maxtac remain the big bad who respond to the only cyberpsycho in town (you, apparently), and not ruin any illusions of their power in Night City
	- Added 5 new Elite NCPD responders to support this rework.
